## Installation

> Todo after functionality is done

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

For initializing Husky properly, run the following command: `npm run prepare`

Since the project uses Husky to ensure some hooks are used properly, it is recommended to use the following commands after npm package installations are done:

    ```
    git config core.hooksPath .husky
    find .git/hooks -type l -exec rm {} \;
    find .husky -type f -exec ln -sf ../../{} .git/hooks/ \;
    ```

## Usage

> Todo after functionality is done

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Testing

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
