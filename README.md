## Installation

### Prerequirements

It is very important to have node, npm and yarn installed.

**nvm** - if you have nvm installed on your machine, please change for the proper version

- Node v20.18.0
- NPM v11.1.0
- Yarn v1.22.10

If Husky is not installed in your system, please also run the folowing command: `npm run prepare` or `yarn run prepare`, it will initialize Husky properly.

### Installation of the required packages

When all the requirements are installed and verified, run `npm install` or `yarn` and all the dependencies will be installed.

Since the project uses Husky to ensure some hooks are used properly, it is recommended to use the following commands after npm package installations are done:

    ```
    git config core.hooksPath .husky
    find .git/hooks -type l -exec rm {} \;
    find .husky -type f -exec ln -sf ../../{} .git/hooks/ \;
    ```

**Note:** if you have the Husky installed, first try to commit `git commit -m "Keep calm and commit ðŸŽ‰"`

## Running

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Testing

> Todo: after Circle CI and unit testing successfully added

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
